| Background | `#F8FAFC` | Clean, neutral background for better product focus |
| Accent | `#3B82F6` | Used for call-to-action buttons and hover effects |

## 🧩 Design Decisions

### Layout Adherence
- All spacing and proportions were implemented using **Tailwind’s spacing scale**, ensuring visual consistency across breakpoints.  
- Design fidelity was validated using **Figma** measurement tools and Tailwind’s utility classes for pixel-perfect alignment.

### Creative Departures
- **Content Strategy:** Simplified product descriptions and direct CTAs for faster user decision-making.  
- **Brand Positioning:** Premium yet approachable — balancing bold colors with minimalist layouts.  
- **MD Breakpoint Adjustments:** Adjusted grid layout and image sizes for better mid-device readability.

## ⚙️ Component Architecture
The app follows a **modular and reusable component structure**, including:
- `Navbar` and `Footer` components for global navigation and branding.  
- `ProductCard` and `ProductList` components to dynamically render data.  
- `CartContext` for global state management of cart operations.  
- `Layout` component for consistent page scaffolding and SEO metadata.

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of product images using `React.lazy` and dynamic imports.  
- Tailwind’s **JIT (Just-In-Time)** mode for minimal CSS payload.  
- Image optimization with **WebP** format and compression tools.  
- Responsive image sets (`srcset`) for optimal delivery on all devices.  
- Code splitting via **React Router** for faster navigation.
